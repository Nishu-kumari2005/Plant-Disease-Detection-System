🌱 AI-Based Plant Disease Diagnosis System
📌 Project Overview

The AI-Based Plant Disease Diagnosis System is a machine learning–powered web application designed to identify plant diseases from leaf images. Farmers or users can upload images of plant leaves, and the system predicts the disease and provides basic remedy suggestions.

This project leverages Deep Learning (CNN) techniques using MobileNetV2 for efficient and accurate disease classification. To improve transparency and trust, Grad-CAM visualization is integrated to highlight the affected regions of the leaf used by the model during prediction.

🎯 Objectives

Detect plant diseases accurately using leaf images

Assist farmers with early disease identification

Provide an easy-to-use web-based interface

Improve model interpretability using Grad-CAM

Enable real-world deployment using a lightweight deep learning model
